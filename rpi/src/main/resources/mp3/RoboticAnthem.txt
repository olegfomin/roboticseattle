The ROBOTIC ANTHEM ...

I used to dread my clock alarm
That awful sound every morning
Still dreaming of a helping arm
A smart machine that keeps on going

Electronic brain takes away my pain
The robotic arm crashes that alarm

The people slogged away at grinding stone
The crying's heard from dusk to dawn
And when it seemed the hope is gone
The robot brings a magic wand

Electronic brain takes away my pain
The robotic might helping humankind

I see the electronic forces all around
Semiconductor circuits are abound
Now as the men and robots are compound
Together we are force and we shall shout: 

Electronic brain takes away my pain
The transistor valve cuts my pain in half

Computer powers growing day to day
The servo mechanisms are getting stronger
The people should not really work today
We shall enjoy the life that would get longer

Electronic brain takes away my pain
Having that device makes the world look nice

Electronic brain takes away my pain
LCDs will glow and the music flow
