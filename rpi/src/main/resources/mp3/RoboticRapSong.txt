ROBOTIC RAP SONG: 

THE ROBOTICS IS SOLUTION  

Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution

Robots doing work for me
While I count one two three

Robots cutting all the wood
I am eating tasty food

Robots making all decisions
I am watching televisions

Robot makes some cash on stock
All I am doing is to talk

Robot is installing lock
I am going for a walk

Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution

Robot is removing dust
I am drinking tea at last

Robots working day and night
I am having fun tonight

Robot promptly lays the gravel
I have never touched the shovel

Robot places dinner set
I am enjoying the sunset

Robot doing all the labour
I am having vine with neighbor

Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution

Robot handles the next task
I have nothing more to ask

The transistors and resistors
Can they make you happy, mister?

Soldering capacitor gives you some audacity

Java-script transforming bytes
Your Safari showing lights

Robot cleaning dirty brook
I am reading the next book

Robots pushing heavy cart
My girl shops with Visa card

Robot is collecting honey
I'll deposit all the money

Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution

Soldering capacitor gives you some audacity ...
