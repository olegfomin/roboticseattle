  <h1 style='text-align: center'>My two songs</h1>
  <p>
      While in the process of S.P.A.R. development I came up with the lyric for two songs on this subject.
      A professional musician made everything else like music and singing happen. Please enjoy ...

        <h3>The Robotic Anthem</h3>
        <p>
          I used to dread my clock alarm<br>
          That awful sound every morning<br>
          Still dreaming of a helping arm<br>
          A smart machine that keeps on going<br><br>

          The people slogged away at grinding stone<br>
          The crying's heard from dusk to dawn<br>
          And when it seemed the hope is gone<br>
          The robot brings a magic wand<br><br>

          <span class="refrain">Electronic brain takes away my pain</span><br>
          The robotic arm crashes that alarm<br>
          <span class="refrain">Electronic brain takes away my pain</span><br>
          The robotic might helping humankind<br><br>

          Computer powers growing day to day<br>
          The servo mechanisms are getting stronger<br>
          The people should not really work today<br>
          We shall enjoy the life that would get longer<br><br>

          I see the electronic forces all around<br>
          Semiconductor circuits are abound<br>
          Now as the men and robots are compound<br>
          Together we are force and we shall shout:<br><br>

          <span class="refrain">Electronic brain takes away my pain</span><br>
          The transistor's valve cuts my pain in half<br>

          <span class="refrain">Electronic brain takes away my pain</span><br>
          LCDs will glow and the music flow<br><br>

          Electronic brain ...<br>

        <h3>The Robotic Rap Song</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="refrain">Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution<br>
            Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution</span><br><br>

            Robots doing work for me<br>
            While I count one two three<br><br>

            Robots cutting all the wood<br>
            I am eating tasty food<br><br>

            Robots making all decisions<br>
            I am watching televisions<br><br>

            Robot makes some cash on stock<br>
            All I am doing is to talk<br><br>

            <span class="refrain">Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution<br>
            Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution</span><br><br>

            Robot is removing dust<br>
            I am drinking tea at last<br><br>

            Robots working day and night<br>
            I am having fun tonight<br><br>

            Robot promptly lays the gravel<br>
            I have never touched the shovel<br><br>

            Robot places dinner set<br>
            I am enjoying the sunset<br><br>

            <span class="refrain">Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution<br>
            Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution</span><br><br>

            Robot handles the next task<br>
            I have nothing more to ask<br><br>

            The transistors and resistors<br>
            Can they make you happy, mister?<br><br>

            Java-script transforming bytes<br>
            Your Safari showing lights<br><br>

            Robot cleaning dirty brook<br>
            I am reading the next book<br><br>

            Robots pushing heavy cart<br>
            My girl shops with Visa card<br><br>

            Robot is collecting honey<br>
            I'll deposit all the money<br><br>

            <span class="refrain">Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution<br>
            Evolution, revolution, the robotics is solution</span><br><br>

            Robots ...<br>
